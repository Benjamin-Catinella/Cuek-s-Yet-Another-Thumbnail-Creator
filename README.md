# QYATC
Quack's Yet Another Thumbnail Creator

Tool i created to automatically generate thumbnails for every videos inside the folder you're in.

Created on Windows, but should work on linux based systems as long as you got [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

Usage:
  ``` py YATC.py ffmpeg_path [width] [height] ```
  
Outputs a .png image with desired width x height.

Default is: 200x200.
